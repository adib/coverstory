#summary How to use coverstory

= Introduction =

Coverstory is a GUI tool for analyzing which lines of your code have actually been executed when you run you test your code. It requires a little set up to use effectively. You must make some target changes in your Xcode project and then you have to run [http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/gcov-3.3.1.html gcov] itself.

To work with Coverstory, first you need to set up your target to work with gcov. This requires turning on "Instrument Program Flow", "Generate Test Coverage Files" and linking with the gcov library.

The EnableGCov.scpt will do this for the current configuration of the current target of the frontmost project.
